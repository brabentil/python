# Algorithm Implementations

This repository contains various algorithm implementations in Python. Each algorithm is contained within its own subfolder, and each subfolder includes a `main.py` file that contains the code for the algorithm.

## Directory Structure

The project is organized into two main categories:
1. `integers`: Contains algorithms related to integer computations.
2. `strings`: Contains algorithms related to string manipulations.

### Integer Algorithms

The `integers` folder contains the following subfolders, each representing a different algorithm:

- `ArmstrongNumber`: Code to check if a number is an Armstrong number.
- `EvenOrOdd`: Code to determine if a number is even or odd.
- `Factorial`: Code to compute the factorial of a number.
- `Fibonacci`: Code to generate Fibonacci numbers.
- `NumberOfDigits`: Code to count the number of digits in a number.
- `Palindrom`: Code to check if a number is a palindrome.
- `PrimeNumber`: Code to check if a number is prime.
- `reverseNumber`: Code to reverse the digits of a number.
- `SumOfDigits`: Code to sum the digits of a number.
- `SwapNumbers`: Code to swap two numbers.

### String Algorithms

The `strings` folder contains the following subfolders, each representing a different algorithm:

- `DuplicateCharacterCount`: Code to find duplicate characters in a string.
- `Reverse String`: Code to reverse an entire string.
- `ReverseEachWord`: Code to reverse each word in a string.

## How to Run

Each subfolder contains a `main.py` file with the implementation of the algorithm. To run any of the algorithms, navigate to the respective subfolder and execute the `main.py` file.

For example, to run the `Factorial` algorithm:

```sh
cd integers/Factorial
python main.py
```
